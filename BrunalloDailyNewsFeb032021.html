<h2>Brunallo Airlines plane has mechanical problems</h2>
<p>Yesterday Brunallo Airlines flight BRU 1725
to London, England took off as normal from<br>
the Brunallosian capital. The flight was going
as planned. When landing at London, the<br>
pilots saw that some of the landing gear could 
not retract. The flight circled near the airport<br>
for around 30 minutes to try and solve the problem.
It did not work, only some of the landing gear<br>
could be retracted. So at landing, it landed a bit on
one side because the wheels deployed on only<br>
one side. The firefighters came and everyone was
evacuated from the aircraft. Everyone is fine.</p>
<h2>Brunallo Airports and Airlines have few passengers</h2>
<p>Today, the CEO of the only airport in Brunallo 
which is near the Brunallosian capital said that<br>
in the month of January, they had around 25000 
passengers compared to around 900000 passengers during<br>
January 2020. The airport hopes that this number 
will rise soon. Brunallo Airlines said that the number<br>
of passengers that they had in January 2021 was around
75% less than passenger numbers in January of 2020.<br>
The numbers are so low because of all the restrictions.
Maybe soon the restrictions will end and we can travel again.</p>
<h2>Greece opens its borders to Brunallosians</h2>
<p>Today, the Greece government announced that
they would open their borders to all Brunallosian<br>
citizens. This means that you do not have to do the
usual 14 days of quarantine when you arrive in Greece.<br>
Instead, you can go directly to your hotel or apartment.
You still do have to quarantine for 14 days when you<br>
arrive in Brunallo. You cannot go to Greece now though 
because of the lockdown but when it ends, you can go.<br>
When the lockdown ends, Brunallo Airlines will be putting 
4 flights a week to Athens. Currently there are 2 flights a week.</p>
