<h2>New quarantine rule stoped hundreds of possible cases</h2>
<p>The Brunallosian health department said
that this new quarantine rule stoped hundreds<br>
and maybe even thousands of possible COVID-19
cases. Today, 67 travellers coming from France<br>
who where in their quarantine tested positive
today. If it was not for this quarantine rule, many<br>
people could have been infected and that number 
is between the hundreds and thousands. Today,<br>
the Brunallosian president said that a surprisingly
big number of people who come from France bring<br>
COVID-19 with them to. He also said that for safety
reasons, this quarantine rule will remain in place until February 9th.</p>
<h2>Brunallo Airlines suspending routes to Canada</h2>
<p>Brunallo Airlines CEO said today that due to 
new travel restrictions in Canada, Brunallo Airlines<br>
will suspend all routes to Canada indefinitely. The
new travel restrictions say that when you arrive in<br>
Canada, you will be tested for COVID in a hotel that
you pay for (the test takes a few days so it would<br>
cost around 1000$). If you test negative, then you are
free to go, if not you have to quarantine for 14 in a<br>
hotel that you payed for. Currently, they have 1 flight 
a week to Toronto from Brunallo and that will be suspended.</p>
<h2>Brunallo travel companies cutting routes</h2>
<p>Today, Brunallo Trains and Brunallo Ferrys said
that they would all cut some frequency of their<br>
routes. They are doing this because of the new rule
that got put in place on Tuesday. This rule says that<br>
all travellers coming from France have to quarantine
for 4 days when they come to Brunallo. Before, there<br>
was no quarantine rule for people coming from France 
so it was the travel companies most profitable route in<br>
2020. The travel companies will cut around 50% of their
frequency to France until the rule ends on February 9th.</p>
