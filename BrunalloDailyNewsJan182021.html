<h2>2 week lockdown starting today</h2>
<p>On Saturday, the Brunallosian President decided
to put his country in a 2 week lockdown to help<br>
stop COVID and to help keep his country safe. In this
lockdown, all non-essential business will be closed<br>
until the First of February but schools will remain open.
Non-essential travel will only be permitted within 100<br>
kilometres of your home. On the First of February, the
President will decide and announce if the lockdown continues.<br></p>
<h2>Some schools chose to close down</h2>
<p>Some school boards decided that due to the rising
COVID-19 numbers, they will be closed during this<br>
lockdown. Only about 20% of schools closed down and
most of these are in the Brunallosian capital where numbers<br>
are pretty high. Many more new cases where reported today
and most of them are in the Brunallosian capital. The children<br>
who where learning at those schools will continue online
learning until the First of February. This is a good step in the<br>
most infected areas to reduce the spread of COVID-19. If the
lockdown continues, they will probably remain closed.
<h2>The few ski resorts allowed to remain open</h2>
<p>The few ski resorts in Brunallo, which are in the Brunallosian
mountains are allowed to stay open. They are allowed to stay<br>
open because people are allowed to come ski. That is because 
this lockdown allows non-essential travel within 100 kilometres<br>
of your home and all of these ski resorts are within 100 kilometres 
of a major city. Also because the ski resorts are outside, there<br>
is a smaller chance that you can spread COVID-19. The only
difference to before is that a face covering will be mandatory<br>
on the ski lifts. Another reason that the ski resorts get to stay
open is that he wants people to get their exercise during<br>
lockdown. Also, the resorts will have 50% of their normal
capacity for safety reasons so book soon!
