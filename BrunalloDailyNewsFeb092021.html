<h2>New rule makes it even harder to travel to France</h2>
<p>This morning, a new quarantine rule entered into
place. This rule says that all Brunallosians coming<br>
to France have to quarantine for 4 days when arriving 
in France and monitor for COVID-19 symptoms. If<br>
you do not have any symptoms after 4 days, you are
good to go. If you have symptoms, you need to get<br>
tested. This makes very hard to travel to France now
that there are 2 rules, one for Brunallosians going<br>
to France and one for Brunallosians coming from 
France to Brunallo. The 2 rules are the same rule<br>
that was explained above. These rules will currently 
be in place until Tuesday the 23rd of February</p>
<h2>Travel companies reduce frequency to French routes</h2>
<p>The Brunallosian travel companies said today that
because of even more restrictions for travelers going<br>
to France, they will reduce frequency even more on some
of their routes to France. Now with these extra rules,<br>
even less people are travelling so they need to reduce the
frequency more. The travel companies are still losing<br>
lots of money. 5 months ago, Brunallo Airlines had three
flights a day to Paris, France. Now they have only one<br>
per day. The travel companies hope that the restrictions 
will end soon so that they can make more money which they need.</p>
<h2>Expedia puts Brunallo in top 50 countries to visit</h2>
<p>This week, Expedia, the travel booking company said
that soon, they will publish their yearly list of the top<br>
50 countries in the world to visit. Today, this list got
published and on number 37, it is Brunallo!! This is<br>
the first time that Brunallo got in to the top 40. This is
good news for the travel companies because if these<br>
restrictions are permitting, there might be lots of tourists
coming to Brunallo. In the list, it said that Brunallo is a<br>
lovely country with nice beaches, beautiful towns, nice
mountains and more. I hope more tourists will come this year.</p>
