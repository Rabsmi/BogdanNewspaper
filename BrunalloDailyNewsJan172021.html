<h2>Brunallosian President announces 2 week lockdown</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the Brunallosian President made a 
speech about what he will be doing to keep his<br>
country safe. In his speech, he said that because of
the rising case numbers, he has decided to put the<br>
whole country in to lockdown starting at 12:01am on
Monday January 18. The lockdown will continue until<br>
the first of February. All non-essential businesses will
be closed but schools will remain open.</p>
<h2> Brunallo transport companies reducing frequency</h2>
<p>Due to the new lockdown measures, all of the Brunallo
transport companies: Brunallo Airlines, Brunallo<br>
Trains, Brunallo Ferrys and Brunallo Buses all said 
that because of the new lockdown and 567 more<br>
new COVID-19 cases today, people will not want to 
travel so much. The lockdown is allowing essential<br> 
travel but non-essential travel will not be permitted 
more than 100kms away from your home to prevent<br>
the spread of COVID-19. Because of this, the travel
companies are reducing their frequency.</p>
<h2>Hilton hotel in Brunallo closing down</h2>
<p>The Hilton hotel which is near the Brunallosian mountains 
has announced that it will close down in July 2021. Even<br>
before the pandemic, the hotel was not so full says the
hotel manager. Now because of the pandemic,<br>
we had around 10% occupancy compared to around 50%
in the other Brunallosian hotels. Even last year we had an<br>
average occupancy rate of 60% compared to 85% at the 
other hotels. This hotel is a bit out of the way and hard<br>
to get there in the mountains being a 3 hour drive from
the Brunallosian capital. It was in a beautiful place but<br>
it is hard to get there and not many people go there. 
Hopefully more people will visit that area soon.
