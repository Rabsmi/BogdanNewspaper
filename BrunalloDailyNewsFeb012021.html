<h2>Brunallosian President announces more lockdown</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the Brunallosian President made
a speech. In that speech, he announced that<br>
the lockdown that was supposed to end today
will be continuing for 2 more weeks until the<br>
15th of February. The President said that this
lockdown will continue because case numbers<br>
are around the same. When we started this lockdown
we had 565 new COVID-19 cases, today, there<br>
are 553 new cases. All non-essential business will
be closed. Also before there was a rule that allowed<br>
non-essential travel within 100 kilometres of your home, 
now it is only 50 kilometres. This is to stop COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Some schools still remain closed</h2>
<p>Today, the main school board in the Brunallosian
capital, Capital school board says that all of their<br>
schools will remain closed during this lockdown.
The school board said that they are continuing to<br>
close schools because all of their schools are in the
Brunallosian capital and that is where 70% of all<br>
COVID-19 cases are. For example today, 412 out of
the 573 cases in the country are in the capital. The<br>
schools where already closed since the start of the 
lockdown and if the lockdown continues, the schools will be closed.</p>
<h2>Some Brunallosian ski hills closing</h2>
<p>Some Brunallosian ski hills have announced that
they will close temporarily due to this lockdown.<br>
In the last 2 weeks you where allowed non-essential 
travel within 100 kilometres of your home. Now<br>
with the new lockdown rules that started yesterday,
non-essential travel will only be permitted within<br>
50 kilometres of your home. This is why some of the
Brunallosian ski hills are closing. Some of the ski<br>
hills are not 50 kilometres away from a major city so
nobody will come to them. That is why they are closing.</p>
