<h2>Brunallosian wind storm delays aircraft</h2>
<p>This morning, a big wind storm was blowing
through the Brunallosian capital. There where<br>
winds of 50 kilometres per hour gusting up to 80
kilometres per hour. Worst of all, at the airport<br>
near the Brunallosian capital, those winds where
crosswinds. This made it hard and almost impossible<br>
to land of take off an aircraft. Due to that, 80% of
flights arriving or departing got delayed. Some<br>
of the arriving flights diverted to other airports due
to the wind. Currently, the winds are lighter and<br>
aircraft are departing and arriving as normal. Most
flights are still delayed  between 30 and 60 minutes.</p>
<h2>Brunallosian President and French President had a meeting</h2>
<p>Today, the Brunallosain President spoke with
the French President Emmanuel Macron. Macron<br>
wanted people coming from Brunallo to France to
quarantine when arriving from Brunallo. This is<br>
because today, 56 people who arrived in France from
Brunallo tested positive for COVID-19 today. The<br>
French President would like a 4 day quarantine rule
for people coming in France to Brunallo. In this rule,<br>
you would check for symptoms during 4 days. If you do
not have symptoms, your are good, if you do, you will be tested.<p>
<h2>New quarantine rule may be put in place</h2>
<p>Today, the Brunallosian President and the French 
President talked about a possible new quarantine<br>
rule for Brunallosians coming in to France. If the rule
gets put in place, it is the same as if you would be<br>
coming from France to Brunallo. Tomorrow the two
Presidents will decide if the want the rule to be put<br>
in place. On Monday, there will be a speech and the
