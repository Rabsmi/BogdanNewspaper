<h2>President announces new vaccine distribution plans.</h2>
<p>Yesterday, during a speech made by the
Brunallosian President, he announced new plans<br>
to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine. He said that
more shipments of the vaccine will be arriving<br>
by cargo plane from Belgium and the United
States. Up to date, 5 planes have arrived with<br>
the vaccine and they have brought 10000 vaccines.
Also, around 10000 people will be vaccinated<br>
by the end of the month. In February, the President
wants to vaccinate 50000 people and that will<br>
mean to bring more planes with the vaccine to Brunallo.
There will be a plane a day with 1750 vaccines coming in February.</p>
<h2>New quarantine rule for travellers coming from France</h2>
<p>The Brunllosian President announced during
his speech yesterday that starting on Tuesday<br>
a new quarantine rule will be put in place. This 
rule says that all of <em>Les Francais</em> who are<br>
coming for France will have to quarantine for 4
days when coming from France and monitor for<br>
any COVID-19 symptom. If they do not have any
symptoms, they are free after 4 days, if they have<br>
symptoms they need to take a COVID test. This 
has been put in place to stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Train derailed in the Brunallosian mountains</h2>
<p>Yesterday at 4:06pm, a passenger train going
to the Brunallosian capital was passing through<br>
the Brunallosian mountains. When it passed a tight
curve, one of the three coaches slid of the tracks.<br>
The coach was lying sideways near the tracks. In
the coach, there where 16 people but they are all<br>
fine as the coach only fell sideways. This derailment
happened because of two reasons. One, the train<br>
driver was speeding a bit as the train went over the 
curve. Two, there was some snow on the track due<br>
to recent snowfall in the mountains. Brunallo Trains 
says that they will try to prevent this from happening again.</p>
