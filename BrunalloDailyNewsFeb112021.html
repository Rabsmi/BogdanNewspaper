<h2>Pleasure travellers going to France drop by 60%</h2>
<p>Brunallo Airlines CEO said that due to the many
quarantine rules for travellers going to France, the<br>
number of pleasure travellers going to France has
dropped by 60 percent. Brunallo Airlines has been<br>
talking to the Brunallosian President that they cannot 
make lots of money with these rules. These rules<br>
are currently doing their job because 43 people who 
where coming from France to Brunallo and were<br>
in their quarantine tested positive for COVID-19 today.
A few months ago when there were no rules for<br>
people going to France, that was the most popular 
destination for pleasure. The rules are set to end on Feb. 23rd.</p>
<h2>Brunallo Trains starting maintnance next week</h2>
<p>Brunallo Trains said today that on Tuesday, they will
start some maintnance on their train tracks. They need<br>
to replace some of their tracks in the mountains. This
job will take from Tuesday to Friday and one kilometer<br>
of track will be replaced. Brunallo trains will also be
doing maintnance in one of their tunells. Due to these<br>
constructions, there will be 50% less trains from Tuesday
to Friday. This is a good time to do the maintnance because<br>
due to COVID-19, not so many people are travelling so not 
many people will be affected by the reduction of train frequency.</p>
<h2>Family day is happening this Monday</h2>
<p>On Monday, it will be family day in Brunallo and other
countries in the world. Family day is a day where you<br>
stay with your familly and enjoy yourself. School will be
closed and most workplaces closed. Due to the lockdown,<br>
there will not be so many celebrations as last year. Still,
there will be a parade and several fun activities in all<br>
of the four major Brunallosian cities. To participate in these
activities, you need to wear a face covering and you need<br>
to practise physical distancing with each other. The Brunallosian
President wishes you a very happy Family Day on Monday.</p>
