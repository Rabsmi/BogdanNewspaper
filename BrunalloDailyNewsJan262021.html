<h2>New quarantine rule starts today</h2>
<p>Today, a new quarantine rule will be put in 
place. On Saturday, the President announced<br>
a new quarantine rule. This rule says that everybody 
coming from France will have to quarantine for<br>
4 days when they get back and monitor to see if
they have symptoms. If they do not, you are free<br>
to go. If you do have symptoms, you need to be
tested. The Brunallosian government says that they<br>
will monitor to make sure that people respect this
rule and if you do not respect it, you will have to pay<br>
half a million euros for the fine. The government hopes 
that this rule will help stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<h2>Brunallo Trains talking about a new tunnel</h2>
<p>Brunallo Trains CEO has announced today 
that his company are in talks to build a new tunnel<br>
through the Brunallosian mountains. The tunnel 
would be around 30 kilometres long. There are<br>
many good reasons to building this tunnel. Firstly,
it would save lots of time because currently, the<br>
track goes through difficult terrain. For trains which
do not stop at the stations in the mountains, it would<br>
save them 30 minutes. The company will talk to see if
they want to build it and then the government has to approve it.</p>
<h2>Brunallosian airport has huge drop in passengers</h2>
<p>Today, the only Brunallosian airport which is located
near the capital reported that it had huge drops in<br>
passenger numbers. In 2019, the airport CEO said 
that they had around 10 million passengers, in 2020<br>
those numbers are around 3 million passengers. This
is a 70% decrease in passenger numbers. The airport<br>
is hopeful that 2021 numbers will be a bit better but
quarantine rules are making travel a lot harder. Now<br>
with the vaccine coming to Brunallo, it might be a bit
easier to travel in 2021. The airport has lost a lot of<br>
money and they hope that over 5 million people will
travel through the airport in 2021. They hope around 10 million in 2023.</p>
