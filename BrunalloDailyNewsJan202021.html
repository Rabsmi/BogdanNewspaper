<h2>Brunallosian Persident considering new quarantine rule</h2>
<p>Today out of the 586 new COVID-19 cases, 
which was the highest number in the last two<br>
weeks, 46 of those cases where from people who 
flew in from France between the 13 and 15th of<br>
January. There is no quarantine rule for France 
because France and Brunallo are like brothers and<br>
sisters. The people who got infected, infected other
people who infected others and so on. That is why<br>
the President is considering to impose a 10 day 
quarantine for all people coming from France.</p>
<h2>Travel companies against possible new quarantine rule</h2>
<p>The Brunallosian travel companies are against a
possible new quarantine rule which would make people<br>
coming from France quarantine for 10 days when entering 
Brunallo. Currently there is no rule. The travel companies<br>
Brunallo Ferrys and Brunallo Airlines are against this new
rule because now their most profitable routes are to France.<br>
This is because people coming from France do not need to
quarantine when they get back. If the rule gets put into<br>
place, the travel companies will have to cut a lot of frequency.
The President will announce if the rule gets in place or not on Saturday.</p>
<h2>Brunallo Trains not affected by lockdown</h2>
<p>The Brunallosian train company, Brunallo Trains has not
and will not be affected by this lockdown. This is because<br>
 people are allowed to travel even in lockdown. That is because 
this lockdown allows non-essential travel within 100 kilometres<br>
of your home. Many people will take a short train ride during
the weekend to the mountains, beautiful old villages or to<br>
go to the beach. Brunallo Trains is happy with this rule and
urges people to come on their trains for a little weekend<br>
trip. Trains are sanitized after every journey and a face covering
is required. Brunallo Trains may increase the frequency on<br>
some of their most popular routes. Also, capacity is limited 
to 75% the normal capacity for safety reasons.
