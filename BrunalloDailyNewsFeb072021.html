<h2>President announces new rules and new lockdown</h2>
<p>This morning, the Brunallosian President made
a speech. In this speech, he said that the lockdown<br>
the country is currently in will be extended for one
more week. This means that the lockdown will end<br>
on Tuesday February 16th. The rules are the same,
all non-essential business are closed and you can<br>
only travel within 50 kilometres of your house non-
essentially. Also, a new quarantine rule will be put<br>
in place on Tuesday, more about that rule will be 
explained on Tuesday. This rule will be put in place<br>
until Tuesday the 23rd. Also the quarantine rule for 
Brunallosians going to France will be extended until the 23rd too.</h2>
<h2>Travel companies against new lockdown and rules</h2>
<p>The Brunallosian travel companies Brunallo Ferrys
and Brunallo Airlines said that they are against more<br>
lockdown and new quarantine rules. With the lockdown, 
people cannot travel and those travel companies lose<br>
lots of money. The routes to France used to be the travel
companies most popular routes during this pandemic<br>
because there where no quarantine rules a few  months
ago. Those routes are much less popular now. They<br>
have spoken with the Brunallosian President to say that
either they want the lockdown to end or they want some money.</p>
<h2>A restaurant in Brunallo receives 3 Michelin stars</h2>
<p>Today, the Michelin restaurant rating group said that
for the first time ever, a restaurant in Brunallo has got<br>
three Michelin stars. The highest possible rating. The
restaurant used to have 2 Michelin stars but when it<br>
got inspected on the 2nd of February, it was so good that
the Michelin inspectors said that it should have three<br>
Michelin stars. This restaurant is located near a beach that
is close to the Brunallosian capital. To eat at this lovely<br>
restaurant, you need to make a reservation a few weeks
in advance. It costs around 300 euros per person.</p>
