<h2>Major snowfall has major impacts on train schedules</h2>
<p>Last night, there was a major snowfall in 
the Brunallosian mountains. Between 10-20<br>
centimetres of snow fell in the mountains. That
means that the train tracks in the mountains<br>
are covered with snow. Because of this, Brunallo
trains has suspended all train operations today.<br>
The cleaning of the tracks is expected to take all
day long. Brunallo Trains will be providing bus<br>
transportation to people who want it when the
roads are drivable. The roads are expected to be<br>
clean of snow by 2pm. Brunallo Trains is apologizing 
for this and says that they are working hard to clean the tracks.</p>
<h2>Brunallosian President making speech today</h2>
<p>Today, at 5pm, the Brunallosian President will
make a speech. In this speech, he will announce<br>
if the lockdown continues in Brunallo. There is a
chance that lockdown will continue because case<br>
numbers are still around the same and this lockdown
did not  do anything to reduce the number of cases.<br>
If the lockdown continues, all non-essential businesses
will be closed, most schools will remain open and<br>
non-essential travel will be permitted within 100km
of your home. Go to BR news at 5pm local time today.</p>
<h2>Over 60 year olds eligible for COVID-19 vaccine</h2>
<p>Today, the Brunallosian Health Department said
that anyone over 60 years old can sign up on the<br>
list to get the COVID-19 vaccine. This is because the
health department also said that almost all people<br>
over 80 years old who signed up for the COVID-19 
vaccine already got it and all people over 80 should<br>
be vaccinated by the 3rd of February. This is why the
government is letting all people over 60 years old to<br>
get on the waiting list for the COVID-19 vaccine. To
sign up to the vaccine list, just go to your local doctor.</p>
